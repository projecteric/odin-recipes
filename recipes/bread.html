                        Cover with a clean damp towel and let rise til double.</li>
                        
                    <li>Punch down; shape into loaf and put in greased loaf pan. Let rise.</li>

                    <li>Bake at 350 for 35 minutes or until bottom sounds hollow when thumped. Can also be shaped into 12 dinner rolls or 8 hamburger buns. Bake for less time if using these shapes.</li>
